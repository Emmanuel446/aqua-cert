# AquaCert — Verifiable Digital Certificates

AquaCert is a web application that enables institutions and organizations to issue and verify tamper-proof digital certificates using the Aqua SDK.  
It brings: trust, transparency, and authenticity to digital credentials — ensuring every certificate is cryptographically signed, traceable, and verifiable.

---

# Overview

AquaCert is integrated with the Aqua JavaScript SDK (Web) for both certificate signing and verification, other features like notarization and witnessing were added but it was simulated
because of the limitations we had while building with the Aqua SDK Web version.  
Each certificate is cryptographically signed using Aqua's `createGenesisRevision()` method, generating a verifiable Aqua Tree Object that serves as proof of authenticity.

Verification runs through the real Aqua SDK's validation logic — confirming Merkle tree integrity and proof hash consistency.  
Other elements such as wallet login and decentralized persistence are **simulated** in this build for demonstration purposes.

# How It Works

# 1. Upload Certificate Data  
Issuers provide essential details:
- Recipient Name  
- Institution  
- Program  
- Date of Issue  

This data is structured into a signed JSON payload ready for processing by the Aqua SDK.

---

# 2. Sign with Aqua SDK  
AquaCert calls `createGenesisRevision()` from the Aqua SDK (Web) to generate:
-  A Tree Object (Merkle proof)
-  A unique cryptographic hash** representing the certificate's fingerprint  

This proof is stored locally (simulating decentralized persistence) and forms the foundation for public verification.

---

# 3. Generate a Shareable Verification Link  
After signing, a shareable verification link is automatically created — for example:

http://localhost:3000/verify?id=PROOF-1762804815496

Recipients (such as employers or institutions) can use this link to **instantly verify** the certificate's authenticity.

---

### 4. Verify Certificate  
The Verify Page auto-fills the certificate proof ID and:
- Retrieves the stored proof object  
- Extracts the Aqua-generated cryptographic hash from the Merkle tree
- Validates the tree structure integrity
- Compares the stored hash against the extracted hash to confirm no tampering has occurred

**Note on Browser SDK Limitations:**  
The Aqua JavaScript SDK (Web) browser version currently provides **only the `createGenesisRevision()` method** for signing.  
Verification methods such as `verifyRevision()`, `verifyProof()`, or similar are **not available in the browser SDK**.

As a result, our verification process:
- ✅ Uses **real Aqua SDK cryptographic data** (Merkle tree hash generated by `createGenesisRevision()`)
- ✅ Performs **hash-based validation** by comparing the Aqua-generated hash
- ✅ Validates **tree structure integrity** to detect tampering
- ⚠️ Does **not use built-in SDK verification methods** (unavailable in browser version)

**Full cryptographic verification** with methods like `verifyRevision()` requires the **Aqua Node SDK** (server-side implementation), which is planned for future production deployment.

This is a **limitation of the browser SDK**, not our implementation. We use the best verification approach available within browser constraints.

# Technical Architecture

# Layer | Description |

- Frontend React (JSX) + TailwindCSS
- SDK Integration Aqua JavaScript SDK (Web)
- Proof Storage LocalStorage (simulated decentralized persistence)
- Signing Logic `createGenesisRevision()` for cryptographic signing
- Verification Logic Hash-based validation using Aqua SDK cryptographic data

# SDK Feature Usage

Feature Description 

- Signing Active | Performed via Aqua SDK `createGenesisRevision()`
- Verification Active (Limited) | Hash-based validation using Aqua-generated proofs (browser SDK has no built-in verification methods)
- Notarization Simulated | Demonstrated conceptually within UI
- Witnessing Simulated | Reserved for future decentralized extensions

**Browser SDK Note:** The Aqua JavaScript SDK (Web) currently exposes only signing functionality (`createGenesisRevision`). Verification methods are not available in the browser version and require the Aqua Node SDK for server-side implementation.

# Summary
AquaCert demonstrates how digital certificates can be signed and verified entirely on-chain logic level using the Aqua SDK.  
While wallet connections and blockchain persistence are simulated, core cryptographic verification is real — proving how Aqua can power the next generation of trustless academic and institutional certifications.
