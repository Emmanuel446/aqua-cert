# AquaCert — Verifiable Digital Certificates
AquaCert is a web application that enables institutions and organizations to upload, issue or generate and verify tamper-proof digital certificates using the Aqua SDK.
It brings: trust, transparency, and authenticity to digital credentials — ensuring every certificate is cryptographically signed,   traceable, and verifiable.

# Overview
AquaCert is integrated with the Aqua JavaScript SDK (Web) for both certificate signing and verification, other features like notarization and witnessing were added but it was simulated
because of the limitations we had while building with the Aqua SDK Web version.
Each certificate is cryptographically signed using Aqua's createGenesisRevision() method, generating a verifiable Aqua Tree Object that serves as proof of authenticity.

Verification runs through the real Aqua SDK's validation logic — confirming Merkle tree integrity and proof hash consistency.
Other elements such as wallet login and decentralized persistence are simulated in this build for demonstration purposes.

# How It Works

1. Certificate Issuance - Two Methods
AquaCert supports two methods for certificate issuance:

Method A: Generate New Certificate

Issuers provide essential details:

- Recipient Name
- Institution
- Program
- Date of Issue
- This data is structured into a signed JSON payload ready for processing by the Aqua SDK.

Method B: Upload Existing Certificate

Issuers can upload pre-designed certificates (PDF or image format) and attach metadata:

- Recipient Name
- Program/Course Name
- Institution/Organization
- Issue Date
- Certificate Type (Completion, Achievement, Degree)
The uploaded file is stored as base64 data alongside the certificate metadata. During verification, the original uploaded certificate is displayed in a full-screen viewer with zoom controls for images and embedded PDF viewer for documents.

2. Sign with Aqua SDK
AquaCert calls createGenesisRevision() from the Aqua SDK (Web) to generate:

A Tree Object (Merkle proof)
A unique cryptographic hash representing the certificate's fingerprint
This proof is stored locally (simulating decentralized persistence) and forms the foundation for public verification. For uploaded certificates, the file data is cryptographically signed along with the metadata, ensuring both the document and its associated information are tamper-proof.

3. Generate a Shareable Verification Link
After signing, a shareable verification link is automatically created — for example:

http://localhost:3000/verify?id=PROOF-1762804815496

Recipients (such as employers or institutions) can use this link to instantly verify the certificate's authenticity.

4. Verify Certificate
The Verify Page auto-fills the certificate proof ID and:

Retrieves the stored proof object
Extracts the Aqua-generated cryptographic hash from the Merkle tree
Validates the tree structure integrity
Compares the stored hash against the extracted hash to confirm no tampering has occurred
For uploaded certificates, displays the original certificate file along with metadata (recipient, institution, program, type, issue date)
Note on Browser SDK Limitations:
The Aqua JavaScript SDK (Web) browser version currently provides only the createGenesisRevision() method for signing.
Verification methods such as verifyRevision(), verifyProof(), or similar are not available in the browser SDK.

As a result, our verification process:

Uses real Aqua SDK cryptographic data (Merkle tree hash generated by createGenesisRevision())
Performs hash-based validation by comparing the Aqua-generated hash
Validates tree structure integrity to detect tampering
Does not use built-in SDK verification methods (unavailable in browser version)
Full cryptographic verification with methods like verifyRevision() requires the Aqua Node SDK (server-side implementation), which is planned for future production deployment.

This is a limitation of the browser SDK, not our implementation. We use the best verification approach available within browser constraints.

Technical Architecture
Layer Description
- Frontend React (JSX) + TailwindCSS
- SDK Integration Aqua JavaScript SDK (Web)
- Proof Storage LocalStorage (simulated decentralized persistence)
- File Storage Base64 encoding for uploaded certificates with automatic cleanup
- Signing Logic createGenesisRevision() for cryptographic signing
- Verification Logic Hash-based validation using Aqua SDK cryptographic data
- Certificate Display PDF viewer and image viewer with zoom controls for uploaded certificates
- SDK Feature Usage

# Feature Description

- Signing Active | Performed via Aqua SDK createGenesisRevision()
- Verification Active (Limited) | Hash-based validation using Aqua-generated proofs (browser SDK has no built-in verification methods)
- Certificate Upload Active | Supports PDF and image files up to 8MB with metadata attachment
- Notarization Simulated | Demonstrated conceptually within UI
- Witnessing Simulated | Reserved for future decentralized extensions
* Browser SDK Note: The Aqua JavaScript SDK (Web) currently exposes only signing functionality (createGenesisRevision). Verification methods are not available in the browser version and require the Aqua Node SDK for server-side implementation.

Built With
- React (JSX) — Modular and dynamic user interface

# Summary
AquaCert demonstrates how digital certificates can be signed and verified entirely on-chain logic level using the Aqua SDK.
While wallet connections and blockchain persistence are simulated, core cryptographic verification is real — proving how Aqua can power the next generation of trustless academic and institutional certifications.
