# AquaCert Project Documentation
**Generated on:** November 12, 2025  
**Project Status:** Frontend Demo with Real Aqua SDK Integration

---

## High-Level Overview

AquaCert is a **frontend-only React application** that demonstrates a complete verifiable digital certificate system using the Aqua SDK for cryptographic proof generation. While positioned as a web app for issuing and verifying certificates with cryptographic proofs and wallet connectivity, this is currently a sophisticated frontend demonstration rather than a production system.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite (Frontend-only, no backend server)
- **SDK Integration:** Aqua JavaScript SDK (`aqua-js-sdk@3.2.1-45`)
- **Storage:** localStorage (simulates database persistence)
- **Wallet Integration:** Wagmi with MetaMask/Trust Wallet support (Sepolia testnet)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS with custom Aqua branding

**Key Capabilities Demonstrated:**
- ✅ Real cryptographic signing via Aqua SDK `createGenesisRevision()`
- ✅ Professional certificate generation and verification UI
- ✅ Wallet connection interface (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance Wallet)
- ✅ Mock notarization and witness networks
- ⚠️ Verification limited to structural validation (browser SDK limitation)
- ⚠️ No real backend or blockchain integration

## Backend Summary

**Important Discovery: This is a frontend-only application with no backend server.**

**Current "Backend" Implementation:**
- **localStorage-based storage** for all certificate data
- **Mock API services** that simulate real backend operations

- **Frontend-only Aqua SDK** integration (browser version limitations)

**Real SDK Usage:**
- ✅ `createGenesisRevision()` for certificate signing
- ✅ Tree object generation and hash extraction
- ⚠️ No access to verification methods (browser SDK limitation)
- ⚠️ Structural validation instead of cryptographic verification

**Mock Services:**
- Notarization service simulates blockchain transactions
- Witness network provides consensus-based approval
- All data persists in browser localStorage
- No real database or server-side operations

## Conclusion

AquaCert represents a sophisticated and well-executed demonstration of blockchain-based certificate verification using the Aqua SDK. The frontend application showcases professional design standards, comprehensive user workflows, and real cryptographic integration. While currently limited to frontend-only implementation with mock backend services, the codebase provides an excellent foundation for building a production-ready certificate verification system.

The project successfully demonstrates the potential of Aqua SDK integration while highlighting both the capabilities and current limitations of browser-based cryptographic operations. The professional UI/UX and comprehensive feature set make this an ideal showcase for stakeholders and a solid starting point for production development.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with backend development and real blockchain integration to transform this impressive prototype into a production-ready platform.
